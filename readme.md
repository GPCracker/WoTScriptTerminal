## WoT Script Terminal

WoT Script Terminal consists of two parts: a server, mod for World of Tanks and client, plug-in for Sublime Text 3.
It provides in-editor WoT Python code debugging, sending script to server side, running in WoT embedded Python, and receiving Python logs back.
It supports multiple connections - any client node can send a script, every node will see its output.
You can allow access from remote computer, changing server address from "localhost" to external interface address. Port also could be changed.
